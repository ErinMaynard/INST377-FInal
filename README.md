INST 377 Group 4 Final Project

Project Name: Book Nook

Project Description:
The idea for our project is to create a resource for people who love reading, but are
having trouble finding new books or series to read. The goal is to make it simple and
easy to use so it is accessible to everyone who may need it. The user can input either
a genre, title, or author into the system and it will return a carousel of books that
match and/or are similar to what they put in. We are using two main resources, one that
is a collection of books with information about them, and another that has popularity
statistics on said books so we can provide users with the best rated material that matches
their input

Target Browsers:
Our main focus is on accessing it from a personal computer, but it will also be avaialable
to those on mobile devices such as IOS and Android.
